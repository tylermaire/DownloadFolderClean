# Downloads Folder Organizer

This Python script helps you to automatically organize files in your Downloads folder into designated subfolders based on their file types. It's a simple and efficient way to keep your Downloads folder uncluttered.

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Sorts files into folders like Images, PDFs, Documents, Music, Videos, etc.
- **Customizable**: Easily add more file types and corresponding folders.
- **Simple to Use**: Just run the script and your Downloads folder will be organized.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No additional installation required, as the script uses standard Python libraries.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the script `organize_downloads.py`.
3. Modify the `download_folder_path` in the script to the path of your Downloads folder. 
   ```python
   download_folder_path = '/Users/yourusername/Downloads'
   ```
4. (Optional) Modify the `file_type_to_folder` dictionary in the script to customize the file types and their corresponding target folders.
5. Run the script:
   ```shell
   python organize_downloads.py
   ```

## File Type Mapping
